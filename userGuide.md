## Using Your Website

### Searching for Cities

When you first open the dashboard, you'll see a search bar at the top of the page. Type any city name into the "Search for a city..." input field and click "Search" or press Enter. The dashboard will immediately load current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast for that location. If the city name is not found, you'll see an error message asking you to check the spelling.

### Viewing Weather Information

After searching for a city, the main weather card displays the current temperature in large numbers, along with the weather condition description and an animated weather icon. Below the temperature, you'll find detailed information including humidity percentage, wind speed, sunrise time, and sunset time. The "Feels like" temperature appears at the bottom of the card to give you a better sense of actual conditions.

### Exploring the 7-Day Forecast

Scroll down to see seven forecast cards arranged horizontally. Each card shows the date, weather icon, high and low temperatures, weather description, and precipitation probability if applicable. You can swipe or scroll horizontally on mobile devices to view all seven days.

### Using Favorite Cities

On the left sidebar, you'll find a "Favorites" section with pre-loaded popular cities including Beijing, New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney. Click any city name to instantly load its weather data. To add the currently displayed city to your favorites, click the heart icon in the top-right corner of the main weather card. The heart will turn red when a city is favorited. To remove a city from favorites, hover over it in the sidebar and click the X button that appears, or click the red heart icon again.

### Understanding the Charts

Below the forecast cards, two interactive charts provide deeper insights. The temperature trend chart shows a line graph of maximum and minimum temperatures across the 7-day period. The precipitation probability chart displays a bar graph indicating the likelihood of rain for each day. Hover over any point or bar to see exact values.

### Dynamic Backgrounds

The dashboard background changes color based on current weather conditions. Sunny weather shows a bright blue gradient, cloudy conditions display gray tones, rainy weather uses darker grays, and nighttime presents deep blue and purple hues. This visual feedback enhances your weather experience at a glance.

## Managing Your Website

### Configuring Settings

Access the Management UI by clicking the settings icon in the top-right corner of the chat interface. In the Settings panel, you can modify the website title and logo under the General section. The Secrets panel allows you to view and update your OpenWeatherMap API key if needed.
